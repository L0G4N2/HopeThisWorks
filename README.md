Trying to add VEX Pro into GitHub

That was the original plan, but now this is storage for my super random and fun code in Visual Studio :)

# VEX_SillyStuff
*Note: Share with whole Club at the end of my senior year...?*  
> Includes code used for fundraising and other VEX projects that I have worked on

# AverageStaticFriction
> Exactly what the title says, it solves for average static friction!  
> I made this because I got bored doing my physics lab, so I made it fun by programming a calculator to run the numbers faster :)  
> It works if you're running an experiment with any number of trials  
> Also converts grams to kilograms!

# Gravitation
> Nothing too fancy, I just got lazy doing my homework, so I made another calculator
> It was a little more complex than anything else I have made, but it was fun :)

# Main
> This is where the magic happens!
> Everything that is in Java runs in this
